# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - More functions, more nested loops' project. In this project, you will further expand your knowledge of C programming by delving into the world of advanced functions and intricate nested loop structures. This repository houses the scripts and C programs necessary to master these advanced concepts, equipping you with the skills needed to tackle more complex programming challenges in C.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop a comprehensive understanding of functions and nested loops in C programming.
- Gain proficiency in creating, using, and managing functions with a focus on complex use cases.
- Master the concept of nested loops and their practical applications in solving problems efficiently.
- Strengthen your problem-solving skills, especially in scenarios that require the use of functions and multiple nested loops.
- Learn techniques to optimize code that uses functions and nested loops, improving both efficiency and readability.
- Develop the ability to identify and fix errors and bugs in code involving functions and nested loops.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a series of scripts, each designed to explore various aspects of C programming, with a primary focus on expanding your understanding of functions and nested loops. This task set aims to enhance your programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Below is a brief summary of the tasks to be tackled:

0. **isupper**
    - **[0-isupper.c:](0-isupper.c)** Write a function that checks for an uppercase character.

1. **isdigit**
    - **[1-isdigit.c:](1-isdigit.c)** Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2. **Collaboration is multiplication**
    - **[2-mul.c:](2-mul.c)** Write a function that multiplies two integers.

3. **The numbers speak for themselves**
    - **[3-print_numbers.c:](3-print_numbers.c)** Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4. **I believe in numbers and signs**
    - **[4-print_most_numbers.c:](4-print_most_numbers.c)** Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4, followed by a new line.

5. **Numbers constitute the only universal language**
    - **[5-more_numbers.c:](5-more_numbers.c)** Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6. **The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**
    - **[6-print_line.c:](6-print_line.c)** Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7. **I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**
    - **[7-print_diagonal.c:](7-print_diagonal.c)** Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8. **You are so much sunshine in every square inch**
    - **[8-print_square.c:](8-print_square.c)** Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

9. **Fizz-Buzz**
    - **[9-fizz_buzz.c:](9-fizz_buzz.c)** Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, with special rules for multiples of 3 and 5 (Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz).

10. **Triangles**
    - **[10-print_triangle.c:](10-print_triangle.c)** Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

11. **The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic (Advanced)**
    - **[100-prime_factor.c:](100-prime_factor.c)** Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

12. **Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper (Advanced)**
    - **[101-print_number.c:](101-print_number.c)** Write a function that prints an integer.

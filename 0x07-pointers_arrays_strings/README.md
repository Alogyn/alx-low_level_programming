# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings' project. In this project, you are poised to delve even deeper into the intricacies of C programming, advancing your proficiency in the use of pointers, arrays, and strings to solve complex problems. This repository serves as your comprehensive resource center, housing the scripts and C programs necessary for you to explore advanced concepts, further your expertise in dynamic memory management, and tackle increasingly sophisticated data structures and string manipulation tasks in C.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Further deepen your understanding of pointers in C, including advanced pointer arithmetic, complex data structures, and pointer-to-pointer-to-pointer scenarios.
- Become an expert in dynamic memory allocation, deallocation, and memory management techniques, including efficient memory reuse.
- Master the art of working with multidimensional arrays and pointers, including arrays of pointers and pointer arrays.
- Hone your skills in advanced string manipulation, including regular expressions, parsing, and handling wide character strings (wchar_t).
- Explore function pointers and their use in creating dynamic and flexible code structures, such as callback mechanisms.
- Learn and apply advanced array algorithms, including searching, sorting, and matrix operations, with a focus on optimization.
- Gain expertise in file input/output operations, file handling, and stream manipulation using pointers.
- Develop the ability to create command-line tools and utilities using C, making effective use of command-line arguments and input/output redirection.
- Apply memory optimization techniques and use profiling tools to identify and rectify memory-related issues in C programs.
- Elevate your error-handling and debugging skills to effectively troubleshoot complex problems in C programs.

## Project Structure

The project aim of delve deeper into the intricacies of C programming. It consists of a series of tasks, each designed to explore advanced aspects of pointers, arrays, and strings, further expanding your comprehension of these fundamental concepts. Below, you'll find a concise overview of the tasks within this subject:

0. **memset**
    - **[0-memset.c:](0-memset.c)** Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte. The `memset` function should fill the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b`. It returns a pointer to the memory area `s`. The standard library provides a similar function called `memset`   .
    
1. **memcpy**
    - **[1-memcpy.c:](1-memcpy.c)** Write a function that copies memory area. The `memcpy` function copies `n` bytes from the memory area `src` to the memory area `dest`. It returns a pointer to `dest`. The standard library provides a similar function called `memcpy`.
    
2. **strchr**
    - **[2-strchr.c:](2-strchr.c)** Write a function that copies memory area. The `memcpy` function copies `n` bytes from the memory area `src` to the memory area `dest`. It returns a pointer to `dest`. The standard library provides a similar function called `memcpy`.
    
3. **strspn**
    - **[3-strspn.c:](3-strspn.c)** Write a function that locates a character in a string. The `strchr` function should return a pointer to the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`, or `NULL` if the character is not found. The standard library provides a similar function called `strchr`.
    
4. **strpbrk**
    - **[4-strpbrk.c:](4-strpbrk.c)** Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring. The `strspn` function should return the number of bytes in the initial segment of `s` that consist only of bytes from `accept`. The standard library provides a similar function called `strspn`.
    
5. **strstr**
    - **[5-strstr.c:](5-strstr.c)** Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. The `strpbrk` function should locate the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string `accept` and return a pointer to that byte in `s`, or `NULL` if no such byte is found. The standard library provides a similar function called `strpbrk`.
    
6. **Chess is mental torture**
    - **[7-print_chessboard.c:](7-print_chessboard.c)** Write a function that locates a substring. The `strstr` function should find the first occurrence of the substring `needle` in the string `haystack` and return a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or `NULL` if the substring is not found. The standard library provides a similar function called `strstr`.
    
7. **The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire**
    - **[8-print_diagsums.c:](8-print_diagsums.c)** Write a function that prints a chessboard. The `print_chessboard` function should take `a` 2D array a representing a chessboard and print its contents. Each character in the array represents a piece on the chessboard.
    
8. **Double pointer, double fun (Advanced)**
    - **[100-set_string.c:](100-set_string.c)** Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char. The `set_string` function should take a pointer to a pointer to a char `s` and set the value of `s` to point to the string `to`.
    
9. **My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure (Advanced)**
    - **[101-crackme_password:](101-crackme_password)** Create a file that contains the password for the `crackme2` executable. The file should contain the exact password with no new lines or extra spaces. You may need to use debugging tools like `ltrace`, `ldd`, `gdb`, and `objdump` to find the password.

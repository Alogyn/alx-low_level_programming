# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Functions, nested loops' project. In this project, you will embark on an in-depth journey into C programming, with a primary focus on functions and the intricacies of nested loops. This repository serves as your resource hub, containing the scripts and C programs essential for you to grasp these crucial concepts and elevate your proficiency in the C programming language.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Master the principles of defining and employing functions in C.
- Acquire proficiency in utilizing nested loops to solve complex problems.
- Extend your comprehension of control flow structures in C programming.
- Enhance your skills in problem-solving through hands-on coding exercises in C.
- Strengthen your foundation in low-level programming, preparing you for more advanced C programming challenges.

## Project Structure

The project comprises a collection of scripts, each dedicated to exploring specific facets of C programming, with a primary emphasis on functions and nested loop constructs. Here's a concise summary of the tasks at hand:

0. **_putchar**
    - **[0-putchar.c:](0-putchar.c)** This task introduces the _putchar function and requires you to print the string "_putchar" followed by a newline character and return 0.

1. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
    - **[1-alphabet.c:](1-alphabet.c)** In this task, you need to create a function that prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a newline character using the _putchar function, with a restriction on the number of times you can use _putchar.

2. **10 x alphabet**
    - **[2-print_alphabet_x10.c:](2-print_alphabet_x10.c)** You are asked to create a function that prints the lowercase alphabet ten times, each followed by a newline character, while adhering to a limited use of the _putchar function.

3. **islower**
    - **[3-islower.c:](3-islower.c)** Write a function that checks if a character is lowercase and returns 1 if true, and 0 if false. You should also use _putchar to print the result.

4. **isalpha**
    - **[4-isalpha.c:](4-isalpha.c)** Create a function that checks if a character is an alphabetic character (either lowercase or uppercase) and returns 1 if true, and 0 if false. Use _putchar to print the result.

5. **Sign**
    - **[5-sign.c:](5-sign.c)** Write a function that prints the sign of an integer. Return 1 and print '+' if the integer is greater than zero, return 0 and print '0' if it's zero, and return -1 and print '-' if it's negative.

6. **There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you**
    - **[6-abs.c:](6-abs.c)** Implement a function that computes and returns the absolute value of an integer.

7. **There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important7-print_last_digit.c**
    - **[7-print_last_digit.c:](7-print_last_digit.c)** Write a function that prints the last digit of an integer and returns the value of the last digit.

8. **I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life**
    - **[8-24_hours.c:](8-24_hours.c)** Create a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer in the format "HH:MM."

9. **Learn your times table**
    - **[9-times_table.c:](9-times_table.c)** Write a function to print the 9 times table in a specific format.

10. **a + b**
    - **[10-add.c:](10-add.c)** Implement a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. **98 Battery Street, the OG**
    - **[11-print_to_98.c:](11-print_to_98.c)** Create a function that prints all natural numbers from a given number 'n' up to 98, separated by commas and spaces.

12. **The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself (Advanced)**
    - **[100-times_table.c:](100-times_table.c)** Write a function that prints the multiplication table for a given number 'n'.

13. **Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women (Advanced)**
    - **[101-natural.c:](101-natural.c)** Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.

14. **In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A (Advanced)**
    - **[102-fibonacci.c:](102-fibonacci.c)** Write a program to print the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, separated by a comma and space.

15. **Even Liber Abbaci (Advanced)**
    - **[103-fibonacci.c:](103-fibonacci.c)** Calculate and print the sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to 4,000,000.

16. **In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+ (Advanced)**
    - **[104-fibonacci.c:](104-fibonacci.c)** Find and print the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, separated by a comma and space, with specific constraints.

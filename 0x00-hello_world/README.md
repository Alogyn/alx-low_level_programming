# 0x00. C - Hello, World - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the "Hello, World" project. In this project, you will learn the basics of C programming and various essential concepts related to it. This repository contains scripts and C programs to help you practice and understand these concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain a deep understanding of the C programming language.
- Appreciate the importance of C in modern software development.
- Understand the structure of a C program.
- Learn how to use a C compiler (e.g., gcc) to compile your programs.
- Understand the concept of variables and data types in C.

## Project Structure

The project contains a series of scripts, each addressing specific tasks related to C basics. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

0. **Preprocessor**
    - **[0-preprocessor:](0-preprocessor)** Run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

1. **Compiler**
    - **[1-compiler:](1-compiler)** Compile a C file but does not link.

2. **Assembler**
    - **[2-assembler:](2-assembler)** Generate the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

3. **Name**
    - **[3-name:](3-name)** Compile a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

4. **Hello, puts**
    - **[4-puts.c:](4-puts.c)** Print exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

5. **Hello, printf**
    - **[5-printf.c:](5-printf.c)** Print exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

6. **Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
    - **[6-size.c:](6-size.c)** Print the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

7. **Intel (Advanced)**
    - **[100-intel:](100-intel)** Generate the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

8. **UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity (Advanced)**
    - **[101-quote.c:](101-quote.c)** Print exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.

# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Singly Linked Lists' project. In this module, you will embark on a journey into the world of linked data structures, focusing specifically on singly linked lists in C programming. Singly linked lists provide an elegant way to organize and manipulate dynamic data, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements. This repository serves as your comprehensive resource, containing scripts and C programs essential for mastering the creation and manipulation of singly linked lists. Get ready to delve into the fundamentals of linked data structures and enhance your ability to design and implement efficient and dynamic C programs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Understanding Linked Lists:** Develop a clear understanding of linked lists as a dynamic data structure, focusing on singly linked lists where each element points to the next in the sequence.
- **Node Definition and Initialization:** Learn how to define a linked list node structure and initialize nodes. Understand the structure of a linked list node, which typically includes data and a pointer to the next node.
- **Insertion and Deletion Operations:** Explore the implementation of insertion and deletion operations for singly linked lists. Understand how to add elements at the beginning, end, or a specific position in the list, as well as how to remove elements.
- **Traversal and Searching:** Grasp the techniques for traversing a singly linked list to access, modify, or search for elements. Understand the iterative process of moving from one node to the next until the end of the list is reached.
- **Memory Management:** Learn about memory management in linked lists, including dynamically allocating and deallocating memory for nodes. Understand the importance of proper memory handling to prevent memory leaks.

## Project Structure

The goal of this project is to delve into the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists in the C programming language. Singly linked lists are fundamental data structures that provide efficient insertion and deletion operations. This project will guide you through various tasks to understand, implement, and manipulate singly linked lists, enhancing your skills in data structure management.

0. **Print list**
    - **[0-print_list.c:](0-print_list.c)** Write a function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list.

1. **List length**
    - **[1-list_len.c:](1-list_len.c)** Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `listint_t` list.

2. **Add node**
    - **[2-add_node.c:](2-add_node.c)** Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` list. 

3. **Add node at the end**
    - **[3-add_node_end.c:](3-add_node_end.c)** Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` list.

4. **Free list**
    - **[4-free_list.c:](4-free_list.c)** Write a function that frees a `listint_t` list.

5. **The Hare and the Tortoise (Advanced)**
    - **[100-first.c:](100-first.c)** In this task, you are required to create a C program that includes a function to print a specific message before the execution of the `main` function. The message, displayed using `printf`, is a poetic excerpt: "You're beat! and yet, you must allow, I bore my house upon my back!" This program simulates a race between a tortoise and a hare, with the additional lines printed before the race description in the `main` function.

6. **Real programmers can write assembly code in any language (Advanced)**
    - **[101-hello_holberton.asm:](101-hello_holberton.asm)** This task challenges you to write a 64-bit assembly program that prints "Hello, Holberton," followed by a new line. The program should use the `printf` function and must be compiled using `nasm` and `gcc` with specific commands provided in the prompt. The goal is to showcase your ability to write assembly code and integrate it into a C program to produce the specified output.

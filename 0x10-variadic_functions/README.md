# 0x10. C - Variadic functions - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Variadic Functions' project. In this module, you will unravel the flexibility and power of variadic functions in C programming. Variadic functions allow you to create functions that can accept a variable number of arguments, enhancing adaptability and versatility in your code. This repository serves as your comprehensive guide, containing scripts and C programs essential for mastering the intricacies of variadic functions. Get ready to explore dynamic and customizable function designs, as you deepen your understanding of this advanced C programming feature and develop the skills to create versatile and efficient programs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Understanding Variadic Functions:** Develop a clear understanding of variadic functions, which allow a function to accept a variable number of arguments.
- **Working with stdarg.h:** Explore the `stdarg.h` header and its macros (`va_list`, `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`) that facilitate the implementation of variadic functions.
- **Variadic Function Declaration:** Learn how to declare and define variadic functions, specifying the fixed and variable parameters. Understand the use of ellipses (...) to indicate a variable number of arguments.
- **Accessing Variable Arguments:** Grasp the techniques for accessing and processing variable arguments within a variadic function using the `va_*` macros. Understand how the function determines the number and type of variable arguments at runtime.
- **Designing Flexible Functions:** Understand how variadic functions enhance the flexibility of your code by allowing functions to adapt to different argument counts and types, providing a powerful tool for building generic functions.

## Project Structure

The aim of this project is to explore and master the usage of variadic functions in the C programming language. Variadic functions allow you to create functions that can accept a variable number of arguments, providing flexibility in your code. This project will guide you through various tasks to understand and apply variadic functions in different scenarios.

0. **Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant**
    - **[0-sum_them_all.c:](0-sum_them_all.c)** Write a function `sum_them_all` that returns the sum of all its parameters.

1. **To be is to be the value of a variable**
    - **[1-print_numbers.c:](1-print_numbers.c)** Write a function `print_numbers` that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

2. **One woman's constant is another woman's variable**
    - **[2-print_strings.c:](2-print_strings.c)** Write a function `print_strings` that prints strings, followed by a new line.

3. **To be is a to be the value of a variable**
    - **[3-print_all.c:](3-print_all.c)** Write a function `print_all` that prints anything.

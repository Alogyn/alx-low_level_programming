# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Pointers, arrays, and strings' project. In this project, you will embark on a journey into the heart of C programming, where you'll explore the powerful concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings. This repository serves as your guide and resource hub, containing the scripts and C programs essential for you to grasp these fundamental concepts and elevate your proficiency in working with C's dynamic memory management, data structures, and text processing capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop a solid understanding of pointers in C, including their syntax, usage, and the concept of memory addresses.
- Gain proficiency in working with arrays, understanding their structure, and implementing various array operations.
- Learn how to manipulate strings in C, including string handling functions and techniques for working with character arrays.
- Explore pointer arithmetic and its role in efficient memory management and array traversal.
- Understand the concept of dynamic memory allocation using functions like malloc, calloc, and free, and apply it in practical scenarios.
- Learn how to use pointers as function arguments and return values, enabling more flexible and efficient code.
- Dive into advanced string manipulation techniques, such as tokenization and string parsing.
- Develop skills for handling errors and edge cases when working with pointers, arrays, and strings.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a series of scripts, each designed to explore various aspects of C programming, with a primary focus on pointers, arrays, and strings. This task set aims to enhance your understanding of these fundamental concepts. Below is a brief summary of the tasks to be tackled:

0. **98 Battery st.**
    - **[0-reset_to_98.c:](0-reset_to_98.c)** Take a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

1. **Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
    - **[1-swap.c:](1-swap.c)** Swap the values of two integers.

2. **This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
    - **[2-strlen.c:](2-strlen.c)** Return the length of a string.

3. **I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
    - **[3-puts.c:](3-puts.c)** Print a string, followed by a new line, to ` stdout`.

4. **I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**
    - **[4-print_rev.c:](4-print_rev.c)** Print a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5. **A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes**
    - **[5-rev_string.c:](5-rev_string.c)** Reverse a string.

6. **Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**
    - **[6-puts2.c:](6-puts2.c)** Print every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7. **Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**
    - **[7-puts_half.c:](7-puts_half.c)** Print half of a string, followed by a new line.

8. **Arrays are not pointers**
    - **[8-print_array.c:](8-print_array.c)** Print `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

9. **strcpy**
    - **[9-strcpy.c:](9-strcpy.c)** Copy the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

10. **Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers  (Advanced)**
    - **[100-atoi.c:](100-atoi.c)** Convert a string to an integer.

11. **Don't hate the hacker, hate the code**
    - **[101-keygen.c:](101-keygen.c)** Generate random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

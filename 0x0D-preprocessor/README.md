# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Preprocessor' project. In this project, you will unravel the mysteries of the C preprocessor, a powerful tool that transforms your code before compilation. The preprocessor plays a pivotal role in code organization, macro creation, and conditional compilation. This repository serves as your guide, containing scripts and C programs essential for mastering the intricacies of the preprocessor. Get ready to delve into preprocessor directives, macros, and conditional compilation, enhancing your ability to write modular, efficient, and flexible C programs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand the concept of macros and how to define and use them using the `#define` directive. Explore how macros can be used for code abstraction and simplification.
- Learn how to use preprocessor directives like `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif` for conditional compilation. Explore how these directives allow you to include or exclude portions of code based on compile-time conditions.
- Grasp the usage of the `#include` directive for file inclusion. Understand how to include header files and other source files to modularize and organize your code.
- Explore the use of macro arguments and variadic macros to create flexible and reusable code. Understand how to define macros that can take a variable number of arguments.
- Familiarize yourself with predefined macros, such as `__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, and `__DATE__`, which provide information about the source file, line number, and compilation date. Learn how to use these macros for debugging and logging purposes.

## Project Structure

The purpose of this project is to delve into the intricacies of the C preprocessor and macros. Understanding the preprocessor is essential for effective code organization, optimization, and creating feature-rich programs. This project is structured to guide you through advanced aspects of preprocessor directives, macros, and conditional compilation, enhancing your skills in utilizing these powerful tools.

0- **Object-like Macro**
    - **[0-object_like_macro.h:](0-object_like_macro.h)** Define a macro named `SIZE` in a header file as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

1- **Pi**
    - **[1-pi.h:](1-pi.h)** Create a header file defining a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

2- **File name**
    - **[2-main.c:](2-main.c)** Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

3- **Function-like macro**
    - **[3-function_like_macro.h:](3-function_like_macro.h)** Create a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

4- **SUM**
    - **[4-sum.h:](4-sum.h)** Define a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of two numbers `x` and `y`.

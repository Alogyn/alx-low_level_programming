# 0x03. C - Debugging - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Debugging' project. In this project, you will immerse yourself in the art of debugging C programs, honing your skills in identifying and fixing issues within your code. This repository serves as your debugging workshop, providing scripts and programs essential for you to become proficient in the fine art of debugging in the C programming language.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop a deep understanding of debugging techniques and strategies in the context of C programming.
- Learn how to identify common errors and bugs in C code, including syntax errors, logical errors, and runtime errors.
- Acquire proficiency in using debugging tools and software, such as GDB (GNU Debugger), to troubleshoot C programs effectively.
- Enhance your ability to analyze and diagnose issues in C programs, leading to more robust and error-free code.
- Gain valuable problem-solving skills that will prove invaluable in real-world C programming projects and scenarios.
- Strengthen your overall C programming skills by becoming a proficient debugger, paving the way for more complex and challenging coding tasks.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a series of scripts, each designed to delve into distinct aspects of C programming, with a primary emphasis on debugging methodologies and practices. Here's a brief summary of the tasks to be tackled:

0. **Multiple mains**
    - **[0-main.c:](0-main.c)** The task requires you to create a test file named 0-main.c to check the positive_or_negative function with the value 0.

1. **Like, comment, subscribe**
    - **[1-main.c:](1-main.c)** The task requires you to comment out the code that causes an infinite loop while keeping the line count the same.

2. **0 > 972?**
    - **[2-largest_number.c:](2-largest_number.c)** In this task, you need to fix the largest_number function so that it correctly returns the largest of three integers.

3. **Leap year**
    - **[3-print_remaining_days.c:](3-print_remaining_days.c)** In this task, you are provided with a program that performs date conversion and calculates the number of days left in the year, taking leap years into consideration.

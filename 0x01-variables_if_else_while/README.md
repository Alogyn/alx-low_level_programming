# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the "C - Variables, if, else, while" project. In this project, you will delve into the fundamentals of C programming, exploring topics such as variables, conditional statements (if, else), and loops (while). This repository houses the scripts and C programs necessary for you to master these key concepts and solidify your understanding of the C programming language.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to declare and use variables in C.
- Learn about conditional statements (if, else) and their usage.
- Explore the concept of loops and how to use the while loop.
- Gain a deeper understanding of the C programming language.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a series of scripts, with each script focusing on distinct aspects of C programming, including variables, if-else conditions, and while loop implementations. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

0. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
    - **[0-positive_or_negative.c:](0-positive_or_negative.c)** Determine whether a random number is positive, negative, or zero.

1. **The last digit**
    - **[1-last_digit.c:](1-last_digit.c)** Print the last digit of a random number.

2. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia...**
    - **[2-print_alphabet.c:](2-print_alphabet.c)** Print the lowercase alphabet using the putchar function.

3. **alphABET**
    - **[3-print_alphabets.c:](3-print_alphabets.c)** Print the lowercase and uppercase alphabet using the putchar function.

4. **When I was having that alphabet soup...**
    - **[4-print_alphabt.c:](4-print_alphabt.c)** Print the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using the putchar function.

5. **Numbers**
    - **[5-print_numbers.c:](5-print_numbers.c)** Print all single-digit numbers in base 10.

6. **Numberz**
    - **[6-print_numberz.c:](6-print_numberz.c)** Print all single-digit numbers in base 10 without using character variables.

7. **Smile in the mirror**
    - **[7-print_tebahpla.c:](7-print_tebahpla.c)** Print the lowercase alphabet in reverse using the putchar function.

8. **Hexadecimal**
    - **[8-print_base16.c:](8-print_base16.c)** Print all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase.

9. **Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
    - **[9-print_comb.c:](9-print_comb.c)** Print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

10. **The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do... (Advanced)**
    - **[100-print_comb3.c:](100-print_comb3.c)** Print all possible combinations of three different digits.

11. **Software is eating the World (Advanced)**
    - **[101-print_comb4.c:](101-print_comb4.c)** Print all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

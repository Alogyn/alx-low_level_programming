# 0x08. C - Recursion- Low-level programming Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Recursion' project. In this project, you will embark on a captivating journey into the concept of recursion in C programming. Recursion, a fundamental programming technique, involves solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems. This repository serves as your dedicated platform, containing scripts and C programs essential for you to grasp the recursive paradigm, refine your problem-solving skills, and apply recursive algorithms effectively in C programming. Get ready to explore the power and elegance of recursive solutions in this exciting project.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop a strong understanding of the concept of recursion, including how functions can call themselves and the logic behind recursive solutions.
- Master the art of designing recursive functions, including identifying base cases, defining recursive cases, and understanding the call stack during recursive function execution.
- Understand the differences between recursive and iterative approaches to problem-solving and recognize scenarios where recursion is a more suitable and elegant solution.
- Apply recursion to traverse tree and graph data structures, including depth-first and breadth-first traversal methods, and understand how recursion simplifies these processes.
- Develop proficiency in debugging recursive functions, understanding the call stack, and identifying and fixing common recursive errors, such as infinite recursion.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills by applying recursive thinking to a wide range of programming challenges and algorithms.

## Project Structure

The goal of this project is to enhance your understanding and proficiency in recursive programming techniques. Through a series of carefully designed tasks, you will explore various aspects of recursion, ranging from basic recursive functions to advanced recursive algorithms. By completing these tasks, you will gain a deep insight into the power and flexibility of recursion, enabling you to tackle complex problems with elegant and efficient solutions:

0. **She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget**
    - **[0-puts_recursion.c:](0-puts_recursion.c)** Create a C function `void _puts_recursion(char *s)` that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.

1. **Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together**
    - **[1-print_rev_recursion.c:](1-print_rev_recursion.c)** Implement a C function `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s)` that prints a string in reverse using recursion.

2. **Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
    - **[2-strlen_recursion.c:](2-strlen_recursion.c)** Write a C function `int _strlen_recursion(char *s)` that returns the length of a string using recursion.

3. **You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
    - **[3-factorial.c:](3-factorial.c)** Create a C function `int factorial(int n)` that returns the factorial of a given number `n`. If `n` is less than 0, return -1. Factorial of 0 is 1.

4. **Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate**
    - **[4-pow_recursion.c:](4-pow_recursion.c)** Implement a C function `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y)` that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. If `y` is less than 0, return -1.

5. **Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
    - **[5-sqrt_recursion.c:](5-sqrt_recursion.c)** Write a C function `int _sqrt_recursion(int n)` that returns the natural square root of a number `n`. If n does not have a natural square root, return -1.

6. **Inception. Is it possible?**
    - **[6-is_prime_number.c:](6-is_prime_number.c)** Create a C function `int is_prime_number(int n)` that returns 1 if the input integer `n` is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7. **They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything (Advanced)**
    - **[100-is_palindrome.c:](100-is_palindrome.c)** Implement a C function `int is_palindrome(char *s)` that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. An empty string is considered a palindrome.

8. **Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible... (Advanced)**
    - **[101-wildcmp.c:](101-wildcmp.c)** Write a C function `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2)` that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. The string `s2` can contain the special character `*`, which can replace any string (including an empty string).
